Quick Downloader
===============
I often use [unsplash.it](https://unsplash.it) in my mobile/web development projects. The website hosts 1000 free stock images, and serves them via a very simple set of APIs. They aid developers like me in serving placeholder images and assets. I created this app that allows you to browse through the catalogue and download interesting images onto your phone. You may use the images as wall papers or for art work.

How to build the code
----------------------------
The app is written in Swift 2.2. After the upcoming Swift 3.0 is released, I will be updating it to swift 3.0, once the libraries themselves are migrated. For now, in order to build the app, you need to have already installed Xcode 7.3 and CocoaPods.

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `pod install`
3. Open Xcode and hit 'Run'


Note
-------
Big thanks for the people who maintain open source libraries which this app is built upon.
